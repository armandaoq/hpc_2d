# hypergraph_product_codes_2d
This is a framework to work with hypergraph product codes, as detailed in [https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02370](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02370). \
The X and Z stabilizers are referred to as top and bottom stabilizers, where the reference is to a length-2 chain complex with two boundaries map, a bottom and a top one.
